// The remaining content of map.js after moving functions
// This file will now primarily serve as an orchestrator or main game loop.
// The original comments about getRandomInt and shuffleArray are removed as they are now in helpers.js
// The original comments about generateDungeon, placeMonsters, interactWithCell, dungeonToSVG, renderMinimap, renderZoomedView, updateVisibility are removed as they are now in mechanics.js and visual.js

// Any remaining global variables or core game logic that doesn't fit into the new modules
// For now, this file will be mostly empty after refactoring.
