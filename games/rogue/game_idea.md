# AI-Generated Dungeon Crawler - Technical Design Document

## Core Concept

A browser-based dungeon crawler that begins as a text adventure and progressively evolves into a rich visual experience through AI-assisted code generation. The game blends programming concepts with magical mechanics, where code generation is integrated into the fantasy narrative as "spellcrafting" and "magical systems."

## Technical Architecture

### Phase-Based Evolution System

#### Phase 1: Text Foundation (Bootstrap)
- Pure text adventure interface
- AI generates underlying data structures for every narrative element
- Location descriptions create JSON schemas: `{ roomId, description, properties, connections }`
- Player actions trigger both narrative responses and code generation
- Foundation systems written in vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility

#### Phase 2: Visual Emergence 
- AI reaches complexity threshold and generates first visual components
- ASCII maps rendered in HTML/CSS
- Simple 2D representations using Canvas API
- Basic UI components generated based on accumulated game data
- Progressive enhancement from text to hybrid text/visual

#### Phase 3: Full Immersion
- WebGL-based 3D rendering
- Dynamic shader generation for lighting and effects
- Complex UI systems with adaptive layouts
- Real-time visual enhancements based on gameplay

### AI Integration Strategy

#### Code Generation Pipeline
1. **Context Analysis**: AI receives current game state, player history, established visual themes
2. **Requirement Extraction**: Narrative elements converted to technical specifications
3. **Code Generation**: AI writes modular JavaScript/CSS/WebGL code
4. **Integration**: Hot-swapping new code into existing systems
5. **Validation**: Performance monitoring and fallback mechanisms

#### Memory & Coherence System
- Graph database in IndexedDB tracking element relationships
- Context objects maintain narrative and technical consistency
- Version control system for player spell/code iterations
- Persistent state management across sessions

## Game Mechanics as Programming Concepts

### Spellcrafting as Code Generation

#### Core Mechanics
- **Syntax Fragments**: Discoverable runes representing code constructs (loops, conditionals, functions)
- **Spell Compilation**: Combining fragments prompts AI to generate executable spell code
- **Debug Mode**: Visual representation of spell code where bugs appear as monsters
- **Performance Optimization**: Ancient spells require refactoring for efficiency

#### Magic Schools as Programming Paradigms
- **Elemental Magic**: Object-oriented programming (fire.createFlame(), water.flow())
- **Time Magic**: Asynchronous programming (promises, async/await)
- **Transmutation**: Functional programming (map, filter, reduce)
- **Summoning**: Class instantiation and inheritance
- **Enchantment**: Event-driven programming

### Progressive Learning System
- Early game: Simple variables and conditionals
- Mid game: Functions, loops, and data structures  
- Late game: Classes, inheritance, async operations
- Endgame: Meta-programming and AI prompt crafting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Runtime Code Generation
```javascript
// Core architecture for hot-swapping generated code
class GameEngine {
  constructor() {
    this.modules = new Map();
    this.context = new GameContext();
  }
  
  async generateAndLoadModule(narrative, gameState) {
    const prompt = this.buildPrompt(narrative, gameState);
    const code = await this.aiService.generateCode(prompt);
    const module = this.validateAndCompile(code);
    this.hotSwapModule(module);
  }
}
```

### AI Service Integration
- **Local Models**: Lightweight models for simple code generation
- **API Integration**: Complex generation via external AI services
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- **Caching**: Generated code cached for performance and consistency

### Performance Considerations
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Generated code runs in isolated contexts
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU/memory limits for generated systems
- **Incremental Loading**: Progressive enhancement without blocking gameplay
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback when generated code fails
