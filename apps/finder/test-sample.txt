Test Plain Text File
=====================

This is a simple plain text file to test the finder's file opening functionality.

Features being tested:
- File content reading for .txt files
- MIME type detection (text/plain)
- Event dispatching with text content
- Decoupled architecture (no desktop dependencies)

Expected behavior:
- Should trigger 'finder-file-content' event
- MIME type should be 'text/plain'
- Category should be 'text'
- Content should include this entire text
- Should read with UTF-8 encoding
